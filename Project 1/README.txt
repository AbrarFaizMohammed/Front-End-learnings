This is a menu page I created for a coffee shop using HTML and CSS. It serves as my initial project in my pursuit to become a full-stack developer. By utilizing the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, I have designed and developed this page to showcase the menu items available at the coffee shop. It marks the beginning of my journey toward gaining expertise in various aspects of web development.
